# chortle
A terminal-based chart downloader for Clone Hero using Chorus.

# Warning
This tool is currently broken because of the website redesign. As far as I can tell, the JSON API is no longer publicly accessible. 
I'm not going to fix this problem, so this tool is now deprecated. For a complete GUI alternative, 
I suggest you use [Bridge](https://github.com/Geomitron/Bridge/tree/v1.4.2).
